## What is *onpoint*?
A full stack platform for construction companies, built to increase transparency and accuracy on large projects by using WiFi fingerprinting. For my capstone use-case, the user takes a photo on their phone or tablet, and *onpoint* does the rest, automatically attaching the room the picture was taken in to the pictureâ€™s metadata using machine learning. This gives each picture more significance, allowing the project team to sort pictures by area, time and other attributes for as-built documentation, progress pictures, or in the event of an insurance or financial claim.

### How does it work?

### Additional functionality notes:

| Feature        | Status           | Notes |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| offline photo storage on jobsite      | complete | |
| offline indoor positioning      | in progress | internet currently required for location services      |
| augmented reality - `Time Machine` feature | future      | |
| SLR camera support | future | additional Raspberry Pi connected to the SLR would be used to send the picture and accomplish indoor positioning |

- onpoint was designed to work on a construction jobsite with the assumption that there is no or intermittent internet:
  - The `Raspberry Pi server` is inexpensive and is intended to be left on the job site in a weatherproof enclosure. The photos will be transmitted from the phone or tablet over the same WiFi that is being used for location purposes.
  - Periodically, the `Raspberry Pi server` (*e.g. once a week*) should be connected to the internet, typically at the job site office, to upload the pictures.
