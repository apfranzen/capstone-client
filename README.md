## What is *onpoint*?
A full stack platform for construction companies, built to increase transparency and accuracy on large projects by using WiFi fingerprinting. For my capstone use-case, the user takes a photo on their phone or tablet, and *onpoint* does the rest, automatically attaching the room the picture was taken in to the pictureâ€™s metadata using machine learning. This gives each picture more significance, allowing the project team to sort pictures by area, time and other attributes for as-built documentation, progress pictures, or in the event of an insurance or financial claim. 

### How does it work?
*onpoint* aggregates river conditions by accessing current USGS (United States Geological Survey) river station data. Combined with fishing reports with local insight from the finishing community, *Anglers* is a valuable resource for your next day on the water.

>### Rivers Aggregated:
- Arkansas
- Upper South Platte
- Blue
- Roaring Fork
